# üê± Backend Challenge: PurrfectMatch - European Cat Adoption Platform

## üéØ Project Overview

You're building the backend for **PurrfectMatch**, a platform that connects cat lovers across the European Union. This platform facilitates cat adoption and community building while handling basic EU-specific regulations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Framework**: Hono.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **API**: GraphQL with Apollo Server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens + Cookie-based auth
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest
- **Documentation**: GraphQL Playground
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Caching**: Redis (containerized)

## üê≥ Docker Requirements

### Multi-Container Architecture

Your application must be containerized with these core services:

1. **API Service**: Node.js application container
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL container
3. **Cache**: Redis container
4. **AI Service**: Dedicated container for AI operations (Week 2)

### Docker Setup Requirements

#### Development Environment

- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for the main API service
- [ ] Set up `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- [ ] Include volume mounts for code changes and database persistence
- [ ] Configure environment variables through `.env` files
- [ ] Set up basic health checks

#### Production Environment

- [ ] Create optimized `Dockerfile` for production builds
- [ ] Set up `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production deployment
- [ ] Configure proper logging

### Docker Best Practices

- [ ] Use specific version tags for base images
- [ ] Run containers as non-root users
- [ ] Minimize image size (target < 300MB for API service)
- [ ] Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. User Management & Authentication

- User registration with email verification
- **Dual Authentication**: JWT-based + Cookie-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure HTTP-only cookies with CSRF protection
- **Refresh Token Strategy**: Implement refresh token rotation
- Role-based access (Adopter, Breeder, Admin)
- Profile management with EU country validation

### 2. Cat Listings & Management

- Cat profiles with photos and basic information
- Breed information
- Health records and vaccination status
- Adoption vs. Sale categorization

### 3. Basic EU Compliance

- Country-specific adoption requirements (3-5 countries)
- Basic insurance requirement validation
- Microchip validation

### 4. Search & Discovery

- Basic search and filtering
- Location-based search with EU country filtering
- Pagination and sorting

### 5. Community Features

- Basic messaging system between users
- User reviews and ratings

### 6. AI Integration (The Tricky Part!)

- **Cat Health Assessment**: Implement an AI service that analyzes uploaded cat photos to detect potential health issues and breed identification
- Expose this as a GraphQL mutation: `analyzeCatHealth(imageUrl: String!): CatHealthAnalysis`
- Use a pre-trained model or integrate with services like Google Vision AI
- Implement basic rate limiting
- **Containerized AI Service**: Run AI operations in a separate container

**Remember**: This is a real-world project that will be used in portfolios. Focus on clean architecture, proper error handling, comprehensive testing, and professional containerization. The AI integration should be a nice-to-have feature that enhances the user experience, not the core functionality.

**Goal**: Complete the project successfully rather than being overwhelmed. Start with core features and add complexity gradually.

Good luck! üöÄ
