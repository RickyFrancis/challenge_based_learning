# 🎯 Challenge-Based Learning

Welcome to the **Challenge-Based Learning** repository!

This project is part of an ongoing collaborative learning initiative between two developers aiming to improve their skills through **project-based**, **gamified**, and **industry-standard** challenges. Each challenge focuses on backend or frontend development, with clear roles, objectives, and deliverables that simulate real-world software engineering workflows.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To **build real-world full-stack applications** by taking turns as backend and frontend developers. Each project emphasizes:

- Hands-on coding experience
- Practical use of frameworks and tools
- Adherence to industry standards
- Clean code architecture
- Documentation, testing, and deployment

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Both developers create a backend challenge for each other at the same time.
2. Each developer works on completing the backend challenge assigned to them.
3. Once both backends are complete, they swap projects.
4. Each developer then builds the frontend for the other person’s backend.
5. This approach ensures both developers are always active — no one is idle during any phase.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Apply **test-driven development (TDD)**
- Learn and use **GraphQL** effectively
- Practice **clean code & architecture**
- Use **Git and GitHub** like a professional team
- Write clear **documentation and deployment instructions**
- Work in a simulated **team environment** with handoffs
